In other words, we\u2019re the people who keep the cloud running. We support all AWS data centers and all of the servers, storage, networking, power, and cooling equipment that ensure our customers have continual access to the innovation they rely on. We work on the most challenging problems, with thousands of variables impacting the supply chain \u2014 and we\u2019re looking for talented people who want to help.<br/><br/>You\u2019ll join a diverse team of software, hardware, and network engineers, supply chain specialists, security experts, operations managers, and other vital roles. You\u2019ll collaborate with people across AWS to help us deliver the highest standards for safety and security while providing seemingly infinite capacity at the lowest possible cost for our customers. And you\u2019ll experience an inclusive culture that welcomes bold ideas and empowers you to own them to completion.<br/><br/>Amazon Web Services (\u201cAWS\u201d) offers a broad set of global compute, storage, database, analytics, application, and deployment services that help organizations move faster, lower IT costs, and scale applications. We are growing quickly and dynamically, including in our global data center footprint. This role is part of the Infrastructure Global Strategy and Planning team, which is responsible for our strategy for data center expansion for edge infrastructure.<br/><br/>In this role, you will build data automation systems to transform interconnect capacity planning across locations. You will create data pipelines and analytics frameworks for infrastructure metrics, while developing Extract, Transform, and Load (ETL) processes to integrate data from heatmaps, CloudForge, build plans, and financial systems. Your work will support both current optimization and long-term planning through data models that connect data center architectures with network designs.<br/><br/>Your main task will be building automated workflows that replace manual processes. This includes creating monitoring systems for capacity constraints, alerts for capacity thresholds, visualization dashboards, and forecasting models. Your work will improve infrastructure cost optimization and growth planning through data-driven insights.<br/><br/>The role requires collaboration with infrastructure teams to capture data requirements and with business stakeholders to convert metrics into actions. You will deliver automated data integration systems, analytics platforms for capacity monitoring, forecasting models, and infrastructure health metrics. By combining data engineering skills with infrastructure planning knowledge, you will build systems that reduce costs and enable network scalability. This role will shape how we use data for infrastructure decisions, requiring both data engineering expertise and understanding of infrastructure planning.<br/><br/>Key job responsibilities<br/>- Build automated data pipelines to collect and analyze infrastructure metrics from multiple sources<br/>- Design and implement ETL workflows to integrate data from heatmaps, CloudForge, build plans, and financial systems<br/>- Develop monitoring systems and dashboards for real-time infrastructure capacity tracking<br/>- Create predictive models for capacity planning and cost optimization<br/>- Automate manual data collection and analysis processes<br/>- Partner with infrastructure teams to deliver data-driven planning insights<br/>- Developing data and API integrations across multiple platforms<br/><br/>A day in the life<br/>A Data Engineer in Edge Infrastructure enables data-driven decisions for one of the world's largest edge networks, transforming raw infrastructure data into actionable insights for capacity planning and optimization. You'll monitor automated data pipelines processing metrics from hundreds of edge sites, design predictive analytics for capacity forecasting, and build machine learning models to identify cost-saving opportunities. Working closely with infrastructure teams, you'll create visualization tools, implement automated alerts, and develop APIs for data access. Your solutions will help transform infrastructure planning from manual analysis to automated, data-driven decision-making, directly impacting Amazon's ability to optimize its global edge network.<br/><br/><br/>About the team<br/>Within AWS Networking, the Internet Edge organization is responsible for connecting Amazon to Internet. With connections to thousands of unique external networks in hundreds of locations across the world, our mission is to deliver an internet-connectivity experience that sets the global standard for performance, availability, security, and cost, making Amazon the clear choice for customers\u2019 needs. Our team provides high-performing internet connectivity for a wide range of use cases, such as retail (amazon.com), video streaming (Prime Video), content delivery (CloudFront), DNS (Route53), AWS services (such as EC2/S3), consumer devices (such as FireTV/Kindle/Echo), and more. <br/><br/>Why AWS<br/>Amazon Web Services (AWS) is the world\u2019s most comprehensive and broadly adopted cloud platform. We pioneered cloud computing and never stopped innovating \u2014 that\u2019s why customers from the most successful startups to Global 500 companies trust our robust suite of products and services to power their businesses.<br/><br/>Diverse Experiences<br/>Amazon values diverse experiences. Even if you do not meet all of the preferred qualifications and skills listed in the job description, we encourage candidates to apply. If your career is just starting, hasn\u2019t followed a traditional path, or includes alternative experiences, don\u2019t let it stop you from applying.<br/><br/>Work/Life Balance<br/>We value work-life harmony. Achieving success at work should never come at the expense of sacrifices at home, which is why we strive for flexibility as part of our working culture. When we feel supported in the workplace and at home, there\u2019s nothing we can\u2019t achieve in the cloud.<br/><br/>Inclusive Team Culture<br/>Here at AWS, it\u2019s in our nature to learn and be curious. Our employee-led affinity groups foster a culture of inclusion that empower us to be proud of our differences. Ongoing events and learning experiences, including our Conversations on Race and Ethnicity (CORE) and AmazeCon conferences, inspire us to never stop embracing our uniqueness.<br/><br/>Mentorship and Career Growth<br/>We\u2019re continuously raising our performance bar as we strive to become Earth\u2019s Best Employer. That\u2019s why you\u2019ll find endless knowledge-sharing, mentorship and other career-advancing resources here to help you develop into a better-rounded professional.",
